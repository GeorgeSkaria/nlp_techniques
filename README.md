Bag of Words:commonly used technique in NLP for text analysis and feature extraction. It's a way to represent text data as a collection of individual words, disregarding grammar and word order but keeping track of word frequency.

Word Vectors:a representation of words as continuous-valued vectors in a multi-dimensional space. These vectors are designed to capture the semantic meaning of words and their relationships with other words.

Regexes: for various tasks involving text processing and pattern matching.

Stemming/Lemmatizing:both aim to reduce words to their base or root forms, but they do so in slightly different ways, and their choice depends on the specific task and requirements.

Stopwords: words that are commonly removed from text data because they are considered to be of little value in terms of information retrieval and analysis. The goal of removing stopwords is to reduce the dimensionality of text data and improve the efficiency and accuracy of text processing tasks.
